# Dog Shelter

## Description

Users can login, search through a list of dogs, filter and sort the list, add dogs to their favorite list, and create a match based on their favorites. This project is a Vite-powered React app using TypeScript. This README will guide you through setting up and running the app locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **npm** or **yarn** - These come bundled with Node.js

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nicholas-Huang713/dog-shelter
cd project-name
```
### 2. Install Dependencies

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```
### 3. Run the Development Server
After installing the dependencies, start the development server. This will start Vite, which will serve your app locally.

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, and you should see an output like this:

```bash
VITE v2.0.0  ready in 300ms

  VITE v2.0.0  ready in 300ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use `--host` to expose

```
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 to see the app running locally.
